## My process

There was no real process as this solution was pretty basic. The hardest part was centering everything on the page and I used relative positioning to acheive this affect. The image is rotated 90 degrees in mobile which was done using a media query. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- relative positioning

### What I learned

This was the first project I used media queries. I went with a mobile first approach. 

The most difficult part of this challenge was centering the QR code both veritically and horizontally on the page. 

For this I used this code: 
```css
.centered {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  margin: auto;
}
```
